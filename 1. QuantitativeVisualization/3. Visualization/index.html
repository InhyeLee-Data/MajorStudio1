        <h2>The Face Value of Portraits</h2>
        
        <div class="description">
            <p>
            <span class="emphasis">A PORTRAIT</span> is an artistic representation of a person, 
            where the face and its expression is predominant. 
            In the past, when the technology for photography was not yet developed or widely available, 
            people with money, opportunities and higher social status had a privilege 
            to hire professional artists to create their likeness in painting. 
            </p>
               
            <p>
            Then, does the size of a portrait tell anything about the social status or power of an individual? 
            Would people of more importance have had a bigger presence on canvas ?
            </p>

            <p>
            For this visualization, the <span class="emphasis">actual dimension</span> of each portrait (width x height) is extracted from each work’s record. 
            This information is used to visually compare portrait sizes in the collection. Group portraits were not included in the visualization in order to stay focused on individuals' prominence.
            </p>

            <p>
                Th Smithsonian Museum’s API search with the <span class="emphasis" style="text-transform:uppercase;"><a href="https://npg.si.edu/">National Portrait Gallery</a></span> returns 507 portraits with dimension information.
                Among those, 
                65 portraits (12.8%) are that of <span class="female">female</span> and 442 paintings (87.2%) are for <span class="male">male</span>.
                
                Similarly, the total physical area created by male portrait is composing about 87% of the total area of portrait. 
                In other words, the total physical area created by male portrait is about 7 times more than the area created by females.
                
                This finding might be considered as one manifestation of how social hierarchy is engraved into the history of portraits.
            </p>

            <p>
            The following visualization of portrait sizes takes a look at only paintings as opposed to other medium such as photography, and pays attention to the physical quality of the medium itself. 
            Painting requires a time-consuming physical process. The subject figure has to sit down for the painter for an extended amount of time and the painter often has to spend days to finish the work on canvas. 
            By looking at the size of the work, we might be able to imagine the time and efforts spent for the portrait and infer the subject figure’s dominance in a society at that time.
